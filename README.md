## Overview

The Community Component Showcase is a dynamic gallery where developers can explore UI components created by the community. Users can search and filter through submissions, copy the generation prompts to use them in their own projects, and (with authentication) submit their own creations.

This project is not just a useful tool but also a learning resource and a starter kit for building applications with the Vercel stack.

## Features

-   **Modern Dark UI:** A sleek, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS.
-   **Dynamic Filtering & Search:** Easily find components by category or keywords.
-   **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login functionality powered by Clerk.
-   **Community Submissions:** Authenticated users can contribute their own components.
-   **Full-Stack Architecture:** Built on Next.js with serverless API routes.
